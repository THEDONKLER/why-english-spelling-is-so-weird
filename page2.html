	<h2 align="center">The main problem with english is that it has never undergone a spelling reform like most other languages. So Modern English spelling is a product of its history</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> To begin, let's see where english gets its vocabulary from. There are mainly 4 "word stocks". <br>All with their own DIFFERENT spelling systems.<br>Here are the 4 word stocks.</h2>
	<div align="center">
		<h3>
		A Germanic core (Anglo-Saxon & Old Norse, old english)<br>
		French (Norman French/ old french, modern parisian french)<br>
		Latin (The Language of Prestige)<br>
		Greek (The Language of Knowledge)</h3></div>
	<h2 align="center">When the Anglo-Saxons first began writing in the Latin script rather than their Runic Script, There weren't enough symbols for all the sounds in their language (old english)</h2>

	<h2 align="center">To deal with the lack of letters, they invented some letters and gave others more than one purpose.</h2>

		English entered the Middle english period when the Normans from France came to England. Their Old French language had a big impact on English.
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
		"ch" in old french made the "ch" in modern english but "ch" in modern french makes the "sh" sound in modern english.
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
	so <b style="color: red;">ch</b>ur<b style="color: red;">ch</b> has a ch sound (as english took it from old french) but <b style="color: red;">ch</b>ampagne makes the "sh" sound because english took it from modern french.
	</h2>
	<h2 align="center">
		Some more modern vs old French influence gives us "qu" being pronounced differently<br>
		scribes thought that the "ch" sound should be "tch" after short vowels. So we have ca<b style="color: red;">tch</b> and du<b style="color: red;">tch</b>. But not everyone liked this, so we have mu<b style="color: red;">ch</b> and su<b style="color: red;">ch</b><br>
		More changes like this came about because scribes couldnt stick to one spelling.
		<br>
		<br>
	<big><big><big><marquee direction = "left" scrollamount = "20" style = "font-family: Georgia;">THEN THE GREAT VOWEL SHIFT! (1350 - 1700)</marquee></big></big></big>
	<br>
	<br>
	For some reason, that we don't know to this day, people just started saying their vowels differently.
	All long vowels in Middle English became different in Modern English.<br><br>
	To make things worse, right in the middle of the vowel shifting (1400s - 1500s), spelling became more standardised due to the printing press in England.<br><br>
	But the people who worked on the printing press and the standardization of english spelling messed up a lot, but english spelling was frozen in time due to their incompetance. <br><br>
	After the standardization was complete, people stopped saying their consonants too! for example, the k and the gh in <b style="color: red;">knight </b>used to be pronounced! But sometimes the gh had an f like in <b style="color: red;">rough</b> or it disappeared completely like in <b style="color: red;">knight</b>.<br><br>
	After more respelling according to latin roots, we have the mess we call English Spelling.<br><br>
